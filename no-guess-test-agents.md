Add this project to my existing personal portfolio (HTML/CSS, GitHub Pages). Match the site’s current design system (CSS variables, fonts, nav, spacing, buttons). Vanilla JS OK. Production/enterprise tone. Keep the title interesting.

PUBLIC-SAFE ONLY:
- No employer/org names, internal product codes, APIs, scopes, hostnames, env vars, registries, repo paths, IDs
- No PHI/PII
- No healthcare/claims/eligibility/benefits/member language
- Use fictional demo data only (e.g. orders_sync, orderId/status/amount, demo.reviewer)
- Do not invent capabilities not listed below

PROJECT:
Title: Fail-Closed Agents for Enterprise Test Automation
Short name: Fail-Closed Agents
Pitch: Enterprise agents that refuse to invent expected behavior—turning approved design evidence into traceable pytest suites behind a hard human gate.
Blurb: In production, “helpful” AI that invents fields, mappings, or outcomes is a liability. This framework inventories evidence, extracts only supported requirements, proposes atomic scenarios and detailed cases, then hard-stops until recorded human approval (approver + timestamp; chat cannot approve). After approval it emits a fixed-layout pytest project with bidirectional traceability, secret redaction, and localized blocking when gaps remain.

DIFFERENTIATORS:
1) Hard approval gate
2) No fabrication (unsupported → blocked / needs clarification)
3) Approved artifacts define expected behavior; implementation code is evidence only
4) Governance as code: IDE rules/skills/auditors + Python runner sharing executable rule fields
5) Independent auditors report only; they don’t rewrite business artifacts
6) Generated projects go only to a verified separate automation checkout

STACK:
Python 3.11, pytest, ruff, jsonschema, PyYAML, Cursor rules/skills/agents, document parsers (Markdown/HTML/JSON/YAML/CSV/XLSX/DOCX/PDF/SQL DDL/OpenAPI/diagrams), secret-provider interface, connectors, evidence/reporting, MCP-style repo/doc adapters, versioned reusable knowledge patterns

PIPELINE (clickable mock stages):
intake → discover → extract → propose → audit → await approval → approve → generate → ready → execute
Overlays: blocked, clarify (localized)

On stage click, show a detail panel with stage purpose + fictional artifact card.
Await = Generate locked. Approve (demo) unlocks Generate with fictional stamp.
Include a conflict toggle: preserve both statements → clarification → block only affected scenario.
Keyboard: arrows between stages; Esc resets. No network calls; inline demo JSON. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

ALSO INCLUDE:
- Architecture layers: governance → workflow/state/artifacts → validators → parsers/integrations → generated project runtime
- Skills vs auditors roster (skills=procedures; auditors=reviewers)
- Fictional generated project tree explorer
- Safety strip (fail-closed, redaction, approval gate)
- Templates: ETL, HTTP API, database, file processing, batch, streaming placeholder (fails closed)
- Stack + extensibility notes

DELIVER:
Fit this as a new section/page in my existing portfolio. Reuse my styles. Mobile-friendly. Output the HTML/CSS/JS to add/change only—don’t rebuild the whole site.
